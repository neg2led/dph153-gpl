/**
 * Implementation of the eap_method_t interface using EAP-AKA.
 *
 * EAP-AKA uses 3rd generation mobile phone standard authentication
 * mechanism for authentication. It is a mutual authentication
 * mechanism which establishs a shared key and therefore supports EAP_ONLY
 * authentication. This implementation follows the standard of the
 * 3GPP2 (S.S0055) and not the one of 3GGP.
 * The shared key used for authentication is from ipsec.secrets. The
 * peers ID is used to query it.
 * The AKA mechanism uses sequence numbers to detect replay attacks. The
 * peer stores the sequence number normally in a USIM and accepts
 * incremental sequence numbers (incremental for lifetime of the USIM). To
 * prevent a complex sequence number management, this implementation uses
 * a sequence number derived from time. It is initialized to the startup
 * time of the daemon. As long as the (UTC) time of the system is not
 * turned back while the daemon is not running, this method is secure.
 * To enable time based SEQs, #define SEQ_CHECK as 1. Default is to accept
 * any SEQ numbers. This allows an attacker to do replay attacks. But since
 * the server has proven his identity via IKE, such an attack is only
 * possible between server and AAA (if any).
