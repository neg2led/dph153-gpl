Roadwarrior <b>carol</b> proposes to gateway <b>moon</b> the syntactically
incorrect cipher suites <b>ike=aes128-sha1-modp1536</b> for the
IKE protocol and <b>esp=aes128-sha</b> for ESP packets. Since <b>sha</b> and
<b>sha1</b> are treated as synonyms the proposal is neverless correctly parsed.
A ping from <b>carol</b> to <b>alice</b> successfully checks the established tunnel.
