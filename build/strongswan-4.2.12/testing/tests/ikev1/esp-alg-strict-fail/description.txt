The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> proposes <b>3DES</b> encryption with SHA-1 authentication
as the only cipher suite for both the ISAKMP and IPsec SA. The gateway <b>moon</b> defines
<b>ike=aes-128-sha</b> only, but will accept any other support algorithm proposed by the peer,
leading to a successful negotiation of Phase 1. Because for Phase 2 <b>moon</b> enforces
<b>esp=aes-128-sha1!</b> by using the strict flag '!', the ISAKMP SA will fail.
